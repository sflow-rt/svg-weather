Real-Time Network Weathermap using SVG

This code is based on the following example:

http://blog.sflow.com/2015/06/leaf-and-spine-traffic-engineering.html

Copy files to the sFlow-RT app directory.

Edit scripts/status.js links and nodes objects to identify data sources.

Use an SVG editor (e.g. SVG-edit) to create a map.svg file representing
network "weather map" - object identifiers must match node and link names
in status.js file.

Restart sFlow-RT to load weather map.

Weathermap diagrams can be abstract, for example the following article
describes how to monitor server pools using sFlow-RT:

The diagram in the article could be re-created as an SVG file and animated
to show live status information based on summary statistics for each pool.
